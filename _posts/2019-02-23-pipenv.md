title: Pipenv, Virtual environment for Python
---

The first project I wanted to make using Python, was to build a web application, and for that, try using the web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). For this I used the book [Django for beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com) and video tutorials from mostly two differents channels on Youtube ([CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g)).

One important thing when you want to work on different projects is to use virtual environements. This allows you to have different configurations for your different projects. Let's say, for example, I want to use the newest Django version for my new project but continue to use an older version for a previous project. It allows you also to have the same configuration each time you you set up your project a new virtual environment.

For this Python project I choose to use Pipenv. The installation is really easy using the Python package manager Pip3 :
```
pip3 install pipenv
```
Using Pipenv to, for example, install Django with a defined version in a new environment you just have to run :
```
pipenv install django==2.1.5
```
In your project folder you can now see two files defining your virtual environment : Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. You can run your environment by running :
```
pipenv shell
```
