As a physicist, I always have been a Data Science enthusiast. And I recently started to take a real interest in Machine Learning. I was watching a really good Youtube channel about Data Science ([Python Programer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68KSmHePPePCjW4v57VPQg)) who presented the book "MACHINE LEARNING for Absolute Beginners" [@mlbeginners], I bought it, and started to read it. I think I will write here some interesting stuff I learn, beginning with this good book.

First, what is Machine Learning (ML) ? From Arthur Samuel, it can be defined as a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed [@samuel1959]. It defines the key characteristic of ML with the concept of *self-learning*. The working is really different from a pre-programmed command like making an addition, where we put an input data and there is directly an answer. With ML, we give data to the machine and, selecting an algorithm and parameters (hyperparameters), it will find relationships and pattern to statistically predict future values.

More posts will follow presenting more details about ML :)
