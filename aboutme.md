title: About me

My name is Mathieu, I'm a physicist and a Software Engineer.

I'm currently working as a Java back-end and front-end developer.

I recently started learning to use Python to apply it to Data science and Machine learning. I will present on this blog some projects i'm working on to learn Python or different libraries applied in Data Science (Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas...) or in Web apps (Django...).
